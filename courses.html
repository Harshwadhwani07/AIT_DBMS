              The Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Ajmer Institute Of Technology is known for imparting state of the art education and preparing its students for real world challenges. The initial "computer-related" courses were started in August 2000 with the intake of 30 students in Computer Engineering and 30 in Information Technology. Currently the department is having an intake of 90 students in Computer Engineering and 60 in Information Technology at B. Tech level. We attract the brightest students from the state who score very high ranks in the engineering entrance examinations, for the PG course, department has an intake of 18 students in Computer Engineering, 18 students in Information Technology and 18 students in Software Engineering. At present, the department is having a 17 regular faculty and guest faculty also, whose interests span in almost all areas of Computer Science. Computer Science and Engineering department is having 9 Computer Labs and a Central Computer Center with latest computer configuration. Each lab is having capacity of 30 computers and Center is having capacity of 100 computers. All the computers are connected in local area network (wired and wireless) with Internet Connection of 1Gbps leased line link and 100 Mbps 1:1 bandwidth. Highly configured servers have been installed department is also having the latest CISCO routers and switches for networking.

              <p>
                Electrical Engineering is a field of engineering that generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electric power distribution and use. Subsequently, broadcasting and recording media made electronics part of daily life. The invention of the transistor, and later the integrated circuit, brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object.
